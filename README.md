# phpstorm-live-templates

## How to use

Clone this library to `~/Library/Preferences/PhpStorm{xxxx}.{x}/templates`. If you've got custom files in there already, please consider adding them (they might be of help to us). If you don't want to share them, add them to the .gitignore.

## Beware

Files only update after you've clicked "OK", "Apply" isn't good enough.

## Magento 2

I've copied this one from `https://github.com/staempfli/magento2-phpstorm-templates/`, in order to edit them to the needs of Elephant. All credit to them though.
